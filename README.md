###Poker definitions:

Poker assumes 5-card hands. e.g. Hand - 1H, 2D, 3C, 4S, JC (A group of 5 cards)

Each pair represents a card. The first digit is called the rank and suit.
In this example, 1,2,3,4,5 are ranks of the card. H - Hearts, D - Diamonds, S - Spades, C - Clubs the alphabet is called(A- Ace, J-Jack, Q-Queen, K-King, T-Ten).

###Hand definitions (in winning order):
* Royal Flush - A straight from a ten to an ace with all five cards of the same suit. In poker all suits are ranked equally. e.g. AS, KS, QS, JS, TS
* Straight Flush - Any straight with all five cards of the same suit. Ace can act as a high or a low card based on how it shows up in the hand. e.g. 5S, 4S, 3S, 2S, AS. Note that in the case where Ace is the high card, it becomes a royal flush.
* Four of a kind - Any four cards of the same rank. If two players share the same Four of a Kind, the bigger fifth card decides who wins. e.g. AH, AS, AD, AC, KH is higher than AH, AS, AD, AC, 3H
* Full House - Any three cards of the same rank together with any two cards of the same rank. The rank of the Three of a Kind determines the winner. e.g. AH, AS, AD, KH, KS is higher than KH, KS, KD, AH, AS
* Flush - Any five cards of the same suit. The highest card of the five determines the rank of the flush. Ace-high flush in this example is the best possible. e.g. AS, TS, 2S, 5S, 6S
* Straight - Any five consecutively ranked cards. Aces can count as either a high or a low card. e.g. 5H, 4A, 3S, 2S, AC
* Three of a kind - Any three cards of the same rank. e.g. AH, AS, AC, KH, QC
* Two pair - Any two cards of the same rank together with another two cards of the same rank. In case of a tie, the highest pair of the two determines the rank of the two-pair. e.g. AH, AC, KH,KS, QC
* One Pair - Any two cards of the same rank. e.g. AH, AS, KH, QS, JD
* High Card - Any hand not in the above-mentioned hands. e.g. AH, KS, JD, 5H, 2D
